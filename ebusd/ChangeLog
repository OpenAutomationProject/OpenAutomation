2013-03-16:
* Fixed slave message CRC check for cyc messages.

2013-03-15:
* Improved cyc commands data handling so all parts from message could be decoded.
* Added new parameter d_part to element configuration part.
* Updated documantation.
* ebusd.init script (debian) slightly modified.

2013-03-06:
* Fixed extension for command files in configuration. A point is not necessary.

2013-03-03:

* Fixed autogen.sh that it worked properly with bourne shell.

2013-03-01:

* Added an example command csv file into contrib directory.
* Changed width of class string from 5 to 20.

2013-02-28:

* Moved eb_cmd* functions from ebus-bus file to new ebus-cmd file.
* Added many explicit casts to remove compiler warnings.

* Fixed memory leak in eb_raw_print_hex twice.
* Added new config parameter print_size to adjust number of bytes at output stream.

2013-02-25:
* Fixed possible memory leaks in eb_raw_print_hex and eb_search_cyc

2013-02-22:
* Added <cr> too each client answer (no need of special config for putty)
* Minor print cosmetic with cyc commands on Master Slave types 

2013-02-21:
* Improved decoding of cyc commands to all ebus message types.
* Added function eb_cyc_data_process to decode all cyc ebus message types.
* Removed hex bitmask of logging output.
* Fixed uninitialized buffer in eb_cyc_data_recv.

2013-02-19:
* Added some usefull description of ebusd to README

2013-02-18:
* Changed name of functions for message handling from eb_send_cmd to eb_msg_execute.
* Changed name of eb_msg_search_hex function to eb_msg_search_cyc.

2013-02-17:
* Added csv tool to print command configuration.
* Added decoding of cyc commands.
* Fixed daemon crash when telnet command window closed without quit signal.
* Split dat (date) decode format into bda (bcd) and hda (hex).
* Split tim (time) decode format into bti (bcd) and hti (hex).
* Added internal buffer for cyc data, so cyc commands can be used like get/set
  to fetch last data.

2013-02-16:
* Structure for commands improved so only one structure for GET/SET/CYC is needed
* Possible formats for GET / SET (asc, bcd, d1b, d1c, d2b, d2c, dat, tim)
* Commands with format hex will return undecoded data.
* Added d_valid to structure. It will be used to check answers with given items.
* Added functions to decode/encode date and time to library.
* Changed CSV file struture to fit new data structure.

2013-02-10:
* Changed decode datatype from int to bcd
* Added bcd, d2b and d2c too available SET commands
* Changed CSV file structur - move comment on position 4

2013-02-09:
* Upgrade the send ability for ebus SET commands. (only d1b and d1c)

2013-02-06:
* Fixed increase length of ebus command from 20 to 30
* Fixed set initiale value of crclen before escape in eb_send_data_prepare()
* Fixed eb_msg_decode_result() do strtok on local copy from r_pos. Maybe
       we don't wont do modife the original value.
* Fixed compare strlen of given command with command from csv file too.
* Added send_retry parameter (2=default) to daemon configuration.

2013-02-04:
* Add the ability to send commands via telnet to daemon
  (This ist just implemented for GET and a few ebus commands for response)
* The telnet commands will collected into a message buffer.
  If the cycle buffer is free, only one command is sent.

2013-02-01:
* Added functions to read ebus command files and load them into nested
  structure. This will be used to send and decode ebus messages. 
* Try to read daemon configuration file at daemon directory too.
* ebus files splitted into ebus-decode and ebus-bus part.
* Moved log.* from src to lib directory and build liblog.a

2013-01-25:
* Added autogen.sh script in main dir. Just type ./autogen.sh for build all.
* Logging functions changed from level to class system. The advantage of this
  system is that different classes can be easily mixed together.
  There are now 8 classes: INF, NOT, WAR, ERR, DBG, EBH, EBS, NET
  and ALL for just all messages.

2013-01-24:
* Added new directory contrib with daemon configuration file
* Added functions with cfg_ prefix (utils). These parse

  Priority of given configuration by:
	1. commandline argurments

	3. default configuration (hard coded)

2013-01-17:
* Initial release
