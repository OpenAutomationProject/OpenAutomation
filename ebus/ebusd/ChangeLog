ebus Daemon (ebusd) - ChangeLog
===============================

2013-02-22:
* Add <cr> too each client answer (no need of special config for putty)
* Minor print cosmetic with cyc commands on Master Slave types 

2013-02-21:
* Improve decoding of cyc commands to all ebus message types.
* Add function eb_cyc_data_process to decode all cyc ebus message types.
* Removed hex bitmask of logging output.
* Fix uninitialized buffer in eb_cyc_data_recv.

2013-02-19:
* Add some usefull description of ebusd to README

2013-02-18:
* Change name of functions for message handling from eb_send_cmd to eb_msg_execute.
* Change name of eb_msg_search_hex function to eb_msg_search_cyc.

2013-02-17:
* Add csv tool to print command configuration.
* Add decoding of cyc commands.
* Fix daemon crash when telnet command window closed without quit signal.
* Split dat (date) decode format into bda (bcd) and hda (hex).
* Split tim (time) decode format into bti (bcd) and hti (hex).
* Add internal buffer for cyc data, so cyc commands can be used like get/set
  to fetch last data.

2013-02-16:
* Structure for commands improved so only one structure for GET/SET/CYC is needed
* Possible formats for GET / SET (asc, bcd, d1b, d1c, d2b, d2c, dat, tim)
* Commands with format hex will return undecoded data.
* Add d_valid to structure. It will be used to check answers with given items.
* Add functions to decode/encode date and time to library.
* Changed CSV file struture to fit new data structure.

2013-02-10:
* Changed decode datatype from int to bcd
* Add bcd, d2b and d2c too available SET commands
* Change CSV file structur - move comment on position 4

2013-02-09:
* Upgrade the send ability for ebus SET commands. (only d1b and d1c)

2013-02-06:
* Fix increase length of ebus command from 20 to 30
* Fix set initiale value of crclen before escape in eb_send_data_prepare()
* Fix in eb_msg_decode_result() do strtok on local copy from r_pos. Maybe
       we don't wont do modife the original value.
* Fix: compare strlen of given command with command from csv file too.
* Add: send_retry parameter (2=default) to daemon configuration.

2013-02-04:
* Add the ability to send commands via telnet to daemon
  (This ist just implemented for GET and a few ebus commands for response)
* The telnet commands will collected into a message buffer.
  If the cycle buffer is free, only one command is sent.

2013-02-01:
* Add functions to read ebus command get files and load them into nested
  structure. This will be used to send and decode ebus messages. 
* Try to read daemon configuration file at daemon directory too.
* ebus files splitted into ebus-decode and ebus-bus part.
* Moved log.* from src to lib directory and build liblog.a

2013-01-25:
* Add autogen.sh script in main dir. Just type ./autogen.sh for build all.
* Logging functions changed from level to class system. The advantage of this
  system is that different classes can be easily mixed together.
  There are now 8 classes: INF, NOT, WAR, ERR, DBG, EBH, EBS, NET
  and ALL for just all messages.

2013-01-24:
* Add new directory contrib with daemon configuration file
* Add functions with cfg_ prefix (utils). These parse 
  the daemon configuration file and set parameters.
  Priority of given configuration by:
	1. commandline argurments
	2. configuration file
	3. default configuration (hard coded)

2013-01-17:
* Initial release
* Prepare Source to compile with GNU Autotools
