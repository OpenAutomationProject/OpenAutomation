===============================

2013-01-25:

  and ALL for just all messages.

2013-01-24:
* Add new directory contrib with daemon configuration file
* Add functions with cfg_ prefix (utils). These parse 
  the daemon configuration file and set parameters.

	1. commandline argurments
	2. configuration file
	3. default configuration (hard coded)

2013-01-17:
