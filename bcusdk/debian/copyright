The eibd client library as well as the header and include files
for the BCU operation system have the following exception:

    In addition to the permissions in the GNU General Public License, 
    you may link the compiled version of this file into combinations
    with other programs, and distribute those combinations without any 
    restriction coming from the use of this file. (The General Public 
    License restrictions do apply in other respects; for example, they 
    cover modification of the file, and distribution when not linked into 
    a combine executable.)

XML Schema files as well as DTD have the requirement:

    Modified version of this specification must change the namespace.

This means, that derived version must use a different the the
namespace as the original version. It does not limit, that
different derived versions may use the same (not original)
namespace/version.
