Directory for initscripts of eibd
After copying NO CHANGES in /etc/init.d/eibd are needed
Just modify /etc/default/eibd for your KNX-Device if not detected automatically
or en-/disable Routing, Tunneling, Cache, Server ...
By default Routing is disabled.

use "eibd.init" as "/etc/init.d/eibd"
use "eibd.default" as "/etc/default/eibd"

This is just a clean backup of a user friendly eibd-initscript from knxuf to make it easier to start eibd.
