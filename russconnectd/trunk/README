*** Russound RNET(R) to EIB/KNX bridge

- eibd is needed for KNX communication, either locally or remote
- uses mainly native Russound-Values
TODO: document various values for Volume, bass,.. better
- controllers and zone-numbers are zero based!
- use socat or Moxa to get serial-data from/to UDP:
	19200 8N1, No flowctrl, no special stop chars needed

*** INSTALL
- needs pthread and libeibclient from bcusdk/eibd
	
*** Group address structure:
- given a start-address the next 256 GA are used per 6 Zones, currently pretty hardcoded
Example: Start-address given 10/1/0

0-9: System/controller-wide
10/1/1 W Power on/off all zones*1
10/1/2 WO Actuator powering the controllers (not yet)

10/1/10 W Zone 1 Power on/off 0/1
... see .ods

W = GA writeable
RS = GA readable/sends status updates on change

*** TODO:
- see various TODO/FIXME in source
- reconnection/error-handling if network-problems occur (mainly eibd?)
- prettify code
- fix dependency on uclibc++ on OpenWRT

*** Outlook
- *maybe* make much more modular and other interfaces (simple UDP/TCP server)
- don't depend on libeibclient then
- *maybe* add outgoing interfaces for mpd,vdr,.. to stick multiroom togehter
