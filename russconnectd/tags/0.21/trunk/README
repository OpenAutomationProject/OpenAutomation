*** Russound RNET(R) to EIB/KNX bridge

- eibd is needed for KNX communication, either locally or remote
(subject to get optional when TCP-Server/lirc-interface is implemented)
- uses mainly native Russound-Values
- controllers and zone-numbers are zero based!
- use socat or Moxa to get serial-data from/to UDP:
	19200 8N1, No flowctrl, no special stop chars needed
Tested and working with CAA6, CAV6, CA4 (one must set six zones, not four!)

*** INSTALL
- needs pthread and libeibclient from bcusdk/eibd, but autotools etc. should 
work for release.tar.gz with
./configure; make; make install
	
*** Group address structure:
- given a start-address the next 256 GA are used per 6 Zones, currently pretty hardcoded
Example: Start-address given 10/1/0

0-9: System/controller-wide
10/1/1 W Power on/off all zones*1
10/1/2 WO Actuator powering the controllers (not yet)

10/1/10 W Zone 1 Power on/off 0/1
... -> see ga_list.ods for an example

*** TODO:
- see various TODO/FIXME in source
- reconnection/error-handling if network-problems occur (mainly eibd?)
- prettify code / split up main.c
- fix dependency on uclibcxx (!?) in OpenWRT Makefile
- supply examples for socat
- directly connect serialport

*** Outlook
- *maybe* make much more modular and other interfaces (simple UDP/TCP server like C0 Z1 VolUp?)
-> implement RIO protocal partially
-> connect to lirc directly?
- don't depend on libeibclient then
- *maybe* add outgoing interfaces for KNX-> mpd,vdr,.. to stick multiroom together (sort of mpc/svdrp-client)
- add at least a KNX-address to switch on/off to avoid ext. logic here

*** PENDING
- make RNET work on C5
- global GA for source of all zones?
